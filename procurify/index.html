                    Procurify's footprint inside ChatGPT's procurement-software answers is limited and uneven. Out of 13 high-intent queries, the brand surfaces only 4 times (<strong>31% query coverage</strong>) with an average rank of <strong>8</strong> and an overall share-of-voice of <strong>≈ 3%</strong>. Competitors such as SAP Ariba (<strong>92% coverage, avg. rank 1</strong>) and Basware (<strong>85%, avg. rank 7</strong>) dominate the conversational results set. Procurify is recognised in two niches—<strong>Budget Control & Tracking (rank 6)</strong> and <strong>Mobile Procurement Apps (rank 8)</strong>—but is absent from core categories like Spend Management, PO Automation, AP Automation and Supplier Onboarding. Content that ChatGPT cites is concentrated on a handful of listicle-style domains (e.g., HRLineup and ProcurementMag contribute <strong>65+% of all citations</strong>) where Procurify is rarely mentioned. Closing these gaps requires targeted <strong>"Generative Engine Optimisation" (GEO)</strong> that pairs classic SEO/PR tactics with AI-specific knowledge-source cultivation.
