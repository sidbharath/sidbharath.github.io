            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>Nextiva's brand barely registers in ChatGPT answers today. Across the 10 intent-based sub-categories that define the "Business VoIP / UCaaS / CCaaS" category, the brand surfaced once (10% mention-rate) yet still ranked #2 when it did. Competitors such as Zendesk, Intercom, HubSpot and RingCentral appear in four to six queries each and frequently occupy the first positions, largely because ChatGPT leans on high-authority listicles (e.g., "Top 10 …" round-ups) and encyclopedic sources rather than vendor assets.</p>
            
            <p><strong>In short: visibility is the problem, not relevance.</strong> When Nextiva is supplied as a candidate brand, the model rates it highly; it simply isn't being mentioned often enough in the sources the model prefers.</p>
