            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>Turo's brand shows up in <strong>≈46%</strong> of the 13 high-intent car-rental queries we audited, but it captures only <strong>4.4%</strong> overall share-of-voice (SoV) and averages <strong>4.3</strong> in ranking — good visibility when it appears, yet overshadowed by the traditional majors (Hertz, Enterprise, Avis, Sixt) that each secure double-digit SoV and blanket nearly every sub-category.</p>
            
            <p>Turo dominates two niches — <strong>peer-to-peer car sharing (rank #1)</strong> and <strong>adventure/overland rentals (rank #1)</strong> — but is absent or low-ranked for mainstream, high-volume topics such as airport, family, budget and business rentals. Only <strong>one first-party citation (turo.com)</strong> was found across all answers, which limits brand authority inside ChatGPT answers that pull heavily from third-party sources such as Wikipedia, Forbes and Future Market Insights.</p>
