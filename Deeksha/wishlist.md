	- Log into the various internal platforms, extract information and create a universal dashboard tying various departments and stake holders.


## Operations:

1. **Fee Collection**
	- Polite reminder calls to Parents before due date, via Knowvo LMS, Whatsapp and phone call
	- Daily monitoring of Fee collected vs receipts raised and flagging of discrepancies.
	- Shift gears to push fee collection by making calls immediately after the due date.
	- Make case by case notes on any concerns raised by Parents on Fee payments (requesting more time, etc) and creating an easy to interpret summary. ⁠
	- Creating dashboards with actionable insights for Deans and AOs to improve efficiency of fee collection.

## Academic:

1. **Enable automatic evaluation of slip tests**
	- Once scanned scripts are provided, grade the individual scripts
	- Mark the scripts with a tick or cross if answer is correct or wrong
	- Provide a detailed analysis for each child
	- Provide a dashboard across all students for the teacher
	- Send the copy of the graded script with marks to the parent via the Knowvo ERP package

2. **Academic MIS**
	- Use the Addmen software to download test ID-wise marks from the OMR sheets uploaded by the campuses
	- Consolidate all the marks
	- Based on the specific test, we adjust the formulas and create the academic review deck, which includes information such as the number of students who fall under various All India Ranks (AIR), the toppers, and those in the Hall of Fame. This entire process takes around 2 hours.
	- Using the server/any platform, identify campuses not uploaded the data (As per requirements) and send an automatic reminder email to the respective campuses until the task is completed 100%

3. **Automatic retrieval of results**
	- In recent days, the NTA website has frequently changed the captcha when we attempt to download students' results. This makes automation using VBA coding or macros quite challenging. We would like to understand whether this process can be automated using any advanced AI technology or coding.

4. **Data Analysis**
	- If I provide the last 3 years of data, can I get the detailed analysis based on our requirements in the presentation template?
	- Currently, ChatGPT will provide these analyses. However, based on our requirements, the analysis should be conducted with the same color template (professionally) and presented using the standard Deeksha Presentation Template.

5. **The process for creating OMR Test IDs and uploading data to be automated.**
	- Each week, we conduct a minimum of 25 to 40 question papers. For each question paper, we need to create a Test ID to upload the students' OMR sheets. To generate these Test IDs, we must provide specific information, including the level of difficulty, answer keys, scoring scheme, OMR pattern, test date, number of questions, and sections for creating the test, as well as the grade and board (CBSE/State, etc.).
	- Currently, the MIS team takes approximately 20 minutes to create one Test ID. Given that the average paper consists of 40 questions, this means that creating Test IDs for 40-question papers takes about 13 hours. If we could automate this process, we would save a significant amount of time.

6. **Tracking student JEE and NEET exam credentials**
	- We are currently in the process of collecting JEE Main application details from students. Each campus is required to submit 100% of their students' information. Currently, all campuses are sending the details in parts via email, and then the MIS team consolidates this information to track the status daily, which is a task assigned to TDS.
	- After receiving the status updates, the MIS team communicates this information to the deans of the respective campuses, indicating whether we have received 100% of the results or a specific percentage. This process will continue until we obtain 100% of the results.
	- If we could automate the process of sending emails, sharing status updates, and informing the MIS team when 100% of the results have been received, it would save approximately 3 to 4 hours of time each day, eliminating the need for manual follow-ups.

7. **Process Optimization**
	- If I key in the MIS deliverables and tasks of the year, can AI suggest how to save time, saving & Manpower, etc
	- We have data regarding the daily MIS tasks, including the time spent on each task, the number of personnel required, and any ad-hoc tasks. If I provide these details to AI, can it suggest ways to save time and reduce manpower costs?

8. **Test ID creation and upload**
	- Each week, we conduct a minimum of 25 to 40 question papers. For each question paper, we need to create a Test ID to upload the students' OMR sheets. To generate these Test IDs, we must provide specific information, including the level of difficulty, answer keys, scoring scheme, OMR pattern, test date, number of questions, and sections for creating the test, as well as the grade and board (CBSE/State, etc.). Currently, the MIS team takes approximately 20 minutes to create one Test ID. Given that the average paper consists of 40 questions, this means that creating Test IDs for 40-question papers takes about 13 hours. If we could automate this process, we would save a significant amount of time.

9. **File conversion**
	- Converting the pdf files (which is with Math Type & Chem Sketch) into editable(including Math Type & Chem Sketch) word file without additional cost.

10. **Data Analysis**
	- Analyze last 5 years papers and highlight topics and concepts of importance across the three subjects

11. **Auto Generating different version(5) of Question Papers(QP) with the SAME Level of Difficulty(LOD) – using the given QP for JEE/NEET/CET courses**
	- I will provide the Level of difficulty, based on the LOD, I need Question papers. (Not randomly provide a question paper)

12. **Generate a Question Paper based on the given chapter/topic and LOD for different course(JEE/NEET/CET)**
